### Hi there, I'm Jason and I love to build web apps, websites, work with APIs and develop inside of Wix and HubSpot! ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a really cool JavaScript Course (to *finally* become strong in JS) and building a Swagger API
- ðŸ”­ I just finished a really cool Git-GitHub course to refresh my skills and using both on real-world projects now!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Velo in Wix to build more complex websites and API integrations with HubSpot
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Vanilla JS projects - my goal for 2022 is to be a solid JS developer
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving my JS skills by collaborating with other devs on JS projects together
